I need to solve the equation √(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7, and find all positive values of x. Hmm, radicals can be tricky, but maybe if I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. Let me try that.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7.\\n\\nOkay, so the idea is to isolate one of the radicals and then square both sides. Let me try moving the second radical to the other side:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) = 7 + √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, if I square both sides, maybe I can get rid of the square roots. Let's do that:\\n\\n(√(x² + 165))² = (7 + √(x² - 52))².\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))².\\n\\nThe right side is expanded using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So the right side becomes 7² + 2*7*√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))², which is 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (x² - 52).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + x² - 52.\\n\\nHmm, let's simplify the right side. The x² terms will cancel out, right? Let's subtract x² from both sides:\\n\\n165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) - 52.\\n\\nSimplify the constants on the right:\\n\\n49 - 52 is -3, so:\\n\\n165 = -3 + 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the radical term:\\n\\n165 + 3 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nSo 168 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nDivide both sides by 14:\\n\\n168 / 14 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\n12 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n\\n12² = x² - 52.\\n\\n144 = x² - 52.\\n\\nAdd 52 to both sides:\\n\\n144 + 52 = x².\\n\\n196 = x².\\n\\nSo x = √196 = 14.\\n\\nBut wait, since the problem states that x is positive, we only take the positive root. So x = 14.\\n\\nBut hold on, when dealing with squaring equations, sometimes extraneous solutions can come up. I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation.\\n\\nLet's plug x = 14 back into the original equation:\\n\\n√(14² + 165) - √(14² - 52) = ?\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n14² is 196.\\n\\nSo first radical: √(196 + 165) = √361 = 19.\\n\\nSecond radical: √(196 - 52) = √144 = 12.\\n\\nSo 19 - 12 = 7, which is exactly the right-hand side. So yes, it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 14. Since the problem says x is positive, we don't have to consider negative roots. So I think that's the answer.\\n</think>To solve the equation \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\\\) for positive \\\\(x\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the given equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Isolate one of the square roots by moving \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\\\) to the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} = 7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165})^2 = (7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52})^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} + (x^2 - 52)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Combine like terms on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 52 + 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Subtract \\\\(x^2\\\\) from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   165 = -3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   168 = 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Divide both sides by 14:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12 = \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12^2 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying:\\n   \\\\[\\n   144 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n9.

Take the positive square root (since \\\\(x\\\\) is positive):\\n    \\\\[\\n    x = \\\\sqrt{196} = 14\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n11. Verify the solution by substituting \\\\(x = 14\\\\) back into the original equation:\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\sqrt{14^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{14^2 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{196 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{196 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{361} - \\\\sqrt{144} = 19 - 12 = 7\\n    \\\\]\\n    The solution checks out.\\n\\nThus, the only positive solution is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{14}\\n\\\\]\",\n 'inference_mode': 'cot'}"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":79},{"cell_type":"code","source":"non_reasoning_data = load_dataset(\"mlabonne/FineTome-100k\").remove_columns(['source', 'score'])\n\nnon_reasoning_data","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-04T10:22:56.783196Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-04T10:22:56.783928Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-04T10:22:57.672106Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-04T10:22:56.783905Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-04T10:22:57.671492Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":98,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"DatasetDict({\n    train: Dataset({\n        features: ['conversations'],\n        num_rows: 100000\n    })\n})"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":98},{"cell_type":"code","source":"non_reasoning_data[\"train\"][0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-04T10:23:15.463330Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-04T10:23:15.463873Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-04T10:23:15.469099Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-04T10:23:15.463850Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-04T10:23:15.468499Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":99,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"{'conversations': [{'from': 'human',\n   'value': 'Explain what boolean operators are, what they do, and provide examples of how they can be used in programming.

Add the constraint that the test taker must write code that handles cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across different programming languages.'},\n  {'from': 'gpt',\n   'value': 'Boolean operators are logical operators used in programming to manipulate boolean values. They operate on one or more boolean operands and return a boolean result. The three main boolean operators are \"AND\" (&&), \"OR\" (||), and \"NOT\" (!).\\n\\nThe \"AND\" operator returns true if both of its operands are true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) and (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"OR\" operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true, and false otherwise. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) or (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"NOT\" operator negates the boolean value of its operand. It returns true if the operand is false, and false if the operand is true. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = not (x > 10)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nOperator precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression. It ensures that expressions are evaluated correctly. In most programming languages, logical AND has higher precedence than logical OR. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nresult = True or False and False  # This expression is evaluated as (True or (False and False)), which is True\\n```\\n\\nShort-circuit evaluation is a behavior where the second operand of a logical operator is not evaluated if the result can be determined based on the value of the first operand. In short-circuit evaluation, if the first operand of an \"AND\" operator is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be false. Similarly, if the first operand of an \"OR\" operator is true, the second operand is not evaluated because the result will always be true.\\n\\nIn programming languages that support short-circuit evaluation natively, you can use it to improve performance or avoid errors. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nif x != 0 and (y / x) > 10:\\n    # Perform some operation\\n```\\n\\nIn languages without native short-circuit evaluation, you can implement your own logic to achieve the same behavior. Here\\'s an example in pseudocode:\\n\\n```\\nif x != 0 {\\n    if (y / x) > 10 {\\n        // Perform some operation\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nTruthiness and falsiness refer to how non-boolean values are evaluated in boolean contexts. In many programming languages, non-zero numbers and non-empty strings are considered truthy, while zero, empty strings, and null/None values are considered falsy.\\n\\nWhen evaluating boolean expressions, truthiness and falsiness come into play. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = x  # The value of x is truthy, so result is also truthy\\n```\\n\\nTo handle cases where truthiness and falsiness are implemented differently across programming languages, you can explicitly check the desired condition. For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = bool(x)  # Explicitly converting x to a boolean value\\n```\\n\\nThis ensures that the result is always a boolean value, regardless of the language\\'s truthiness and falsiness rules.'}]}"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":99},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fast_model, fast_tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(model_name=\"unsloth/Qwen3-1.7B-unsloth-bnb-4bit\", load_in_4bit=True)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-04T10:26:27.407173Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-04T10:26:27.407788Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-04T10:26:40.225096Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-04T10:26:27.407764Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-04T10:26:40.224262Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"==((====))==  Unsloth 2025.8.1: Fast Qwen3 patching.

Wait, actually, convergence of the series only requires that the terms approach zero, but they don't necessarily have to be decreasing. For example, even if the terms bounce around a bit but still approach zero, the series can still converge if they do so quickly enough. But since the problem states a_n ≥ 0, we don't have to worry about negative terms messing up the convergence through cancellation.\\n\\nNow, the question is about the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²). We need to figure out if this series converges or diverges. Let me think about how the terms of this new series compare to the original series. Since each a_n is non-negative, a_n² is also non-negative, and dividing by 1 + a_n² will make each term of the new series non-negative as well. So, we're dealing with a series of non-negative terms, which is good because tests like the comparison test apply.\\n\\nLet me recall the comparison test: if 0 ≤ b_n ≤ c_n for all n, and ∑c_n converges, then ∑b_n converges. Conversely, if ∑b_n diverges, then ∑c_n diverges. So, if I can compare (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) to some other series that I know converges or diverges, that could help.\\n\\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the limit comparison test. If I take the limit of [ (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ] / a_n as n approaches infinity, that might tell me something. Let's compute that limit.\\n\\nLimit as n → ∞ of [ (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ] / a_n = limit of [a_n² / (a_n(1 + a_n²))] = limit of [a_n / (1 + a_n²)].\\n\\nNow, since ∑a_n converges, we know that a_n must approach 0. So as n becomes large, a_n is approaching 0. Therefore, the denominator 1 + a_n² approaches 1. So the entire expression is approximately a_n / 1 = a_n. Therefore, the limit is 0. \\n\\nWait, but in the limit comparison test, if the limit is 0 and ∑a_n converges, then if the original series (the one with terms (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²)) is being compared to a convergent series, then what's the conclusion?\\n\\nHmm, let me recall: If the limit of b_n / c_n is 0, and ∑c_n converges, then ∑b_n converges. Because if b_n is eventually less than c_n, then the comparison test applies. So since (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) / a_n → 0, and ∑a_n converges, then by the limit comparison test, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) also converges. \\n\\nWait, that seems straightforward, right? Because the limit is 0, which is finite, and the series we're comparing to (∑a_n) converges. Therefore, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) must converge. \\n\\nBut let me verify this with another approach to make sure I'm not missing something. Let's think about the behavior of the terms (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²). Since a_n is non-negative and approaching 0, when n is large enough, a_n is less than or equal to 1, right? Because if a_n approaches 0, there exists some N such that for all n ≥ N, a_n ≤ 1. So for those n, a_n² ≤ a_n. Therefore, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n² ≤ a_n. \\n\\nTherefore, for n ≥ N, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n. Since ∑a_n converges, then by comparison test, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) also converges. \\n\\nWait, that's a different argument. Let's see. So if a_n is less than or equal to 1, then a_n² is less than or equal to a_n, so (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n² ≤ a_n. Therefore, since ∑a_n converges, the tail of the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) is dominated by ∑a_n, hence converges. Therefore, the entire series converges.\\n\\nAlternatively, even if a_n is sometimes greater than 1, but since the series ∑a_n converges, the terms a_n must approach zero, so beyond some N, they are all less than 1. So the initial terms where a_n might be greater than 1 can only contribute finitely many terms to the series, which doesn't affect convergence. Therefore, we can ignore those and focus on the tail where a_n < 1. Then, as above, in that region, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n² ≤ a_n, so again, since ∑a_n converges, so does ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²).\\n\\nAlternatively, another way to think about it is to note that (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) is approximately a_n² when a_n is small. Since a_n approaches 0, a_n² is going to be much smaller than a_n. Therefore, if ∑a_n converges, then ∑a_n² might also converge, but actually, that's not necessarily always true. For example, take a_n = 1/n. Then ∑a_n diverges, but ∑a_n² converges. But in this problem, ∑a_n converges. So, for example, if a_n = 1/n², then ∑a_n converges (it's a p-series with p=2>1), and ∑a_n² would be ∑1/n^4, which also converges. But if a_n is 1/n^(1/2), but then ∑a_n would diverge. But in our problem, ∑a_n converges.\\n\\nWait, but the convergence of ∑a_n doesn't necessarily imply that a_n is summable with a higher exponent. For example, take a_n = 1/(n(log n)^2), which converges (by the integral test), then a_n² = 1/(n²(log n)^4), which would converge as well. But if a_n is like 1/n^(1/2 + ε) for some ε>0, then ∑a_n converges if 1/2 + ε > 1, i.e., ε > 1/2. Then a_n² would be 1/n^(1 + 2ε), which converges as well. So in these cases, if a_n is eventually small enough such that ∑a_n converges, then a_n² is even smaller, so ∑a_n² converges. However, perhaps there is a case where ∑a_n converges but ∑a_n² diverges? Hmm. Wait, no. If a_n is non-negative and ∑a_n converges, then a_n must approach zero, and for sufficiently large n, a_n ≤1. Therefore, a_n² ≤ a_n for those n, hence ∑a_n² converges by comparison to ∑a_n. Wait, that's true, isn't it? If a_n is eventually less than or equal to 1, then a_n² ≤ a_n, so ∑a_n² converges. Therefore, in our problem, the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) is dominated by ∑a_n², which is dominated by ∑a_n. So, if we can bound (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n², and ∑a_n² converges, then ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) would converge as well.\\n\\nBut actually, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n², right? Because 1 + a_n² ≥1, so dividing by something bigger than 1 makes the fraction smaller. So (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n². And since ∑a_n² converges, as I thought before, then by comparison, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) also converges.\\n\\nWait, but I had earlier compared (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) directly to a_n and used the limit comparison test. So both approaches seem valid. Let me just check with an example. Suppose a_n = 1/n². Then ∑a_n converges. Then (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) = (1/n^4)/(1 + 1/n²) = 1/(n^4 + n²) ≈ 1/n^4 for large n, so the series ∑1/(n^4 + n²) converges. Another example: a_n = 1/n. But wait, ∑a_n diverges here, which doesn't fit the problem's condition. So if a_n is 1/n^p with p>1, then ∑a_n converges, and ∑a_n² converges as well. \\n\\nAlternatively, take a_n = 1/(n^(1/2 + ε)), with ε > 1/2 so that ∑a_n converges. Then a_n² = 1/n^{1 + 2ε}, and since 1 + 2ε > 1, ∑a_n² converges. \\n\\nBut actually, the key point here is that since a_n tends to 0, for sufficiently large n, a_n ≤1, so a_n² ≤ a_n, so ∑a_n² is dominated by ∑a_n. Therefore, ∑a_n² converges, and since (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ a_n², then ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges as well. Therefore, the series in question converges.\\n\\nWait, but maybe I should be careful here. Let me think again. If a_n is 0, then the term is 0. If a_n is very large, say approaching infinity, but wait, in our case, a_n approaches 0, so that's not possible. But in the problem, the series ∑a_n is convergent, so the terms a_n must approach zero. Therefore, beyond some N, a_n ≤1, so the denominator 1 + a_n² ≥1, hence (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤a_n². Therefore, for all n beyond N, the terms are bounded above by a_n², which is summable because a_n² ≤ a_n for n ≥N (since a_n ≤1). Therefore, ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges by comparison to ∑a_n.\\n\\nAlternatively, to put it more formally:\\n\\nSince ∑a_n converges, a_n →0. Therefore, there exists N such that for all n ≥N, a_n ≤1. For those n, a_n² ≤a_n. Therefore, (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤a_n² ≤a_n. Hence, ∑_{n=N}^∞ (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ ∑_{n=N}^∞ a_n < ∞. Therefore, the tail converges, and adding the first N-1 terms (which are finite) doesn't affect convergence. Therefore, the entire series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges.\\n\\nAlternatively, another approach: note that (a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) ≤ min(a_n², 1). But since a_n →0, eventually min(a_n², 1) = a_n², so again, ∑a_n² converges. So this gives another way to see it.\\n\\nWait, but in all these approaches, the conclusion is the same: the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 + a_n²) converges. Therefore, the answer should be that the series converges.\\n\\nBut wait, let me check with a concrete example where a_n is sometimes large. Suppose a_n is 1 for some n. Then (1^2)/(1 +1^2)=1/2. But since ∑a_n converges, a_n must approach 0, so only finitely many terms can be ≥1. So those terms contribute a finite sum, and the rest of the terms where a_n <1 can be compared to a_n² or a_n. Therefore, even if there are a few terms where a_n is large, they don't affect the convergence of the series.\\n\\nFor example, take a_n = 2 for n=1, and a_n =1/n² for n≥2. Then ∑a_n =2 + ∑1/n², which converges. Then ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) = (4/5) + ∑_{n=2}^∞ [ (1/n^4)/(1 +1/n²) ] = 4/5 + ∑_{n=2}^\\\\infty [1/(n^4 +n²)]. Since the tail is convergent, the entire series converges.\\n\\nAnother test case: a_n =1 for n=1, and a_n=0 for n≥2. Then ∑a_n converges (sum is 1), and ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²)=1/2 + 0, which is obviously convergent.\\n\\nSo, all these test cases support the conclusion that ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) converges.\\n\\nBut let me think if there could be any counterexample. Suppose ∑a_n converges, but ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) diverges. Is that possible?\\n\\nIf ∑a_n converges, then a_n →0. So for sufficiently large n, a_n is small. Therefore, (a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) ≈ a_n². Therefore, if ∑a_n² diverges, then ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) would also diverge. But can ∑a_n converge while ∑a_n² diverges?\\n\\nWait, but earlier, we thought that if a_n ≤1 for sufficiently large n, then a_n² ≤ a_n, so ∑a_n² converges by comparison. Therefore, if ∑a_n converges, then ∑a_n² must converge as well. Therefore, ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) is dominated by ∑a_n², which converges, hence itself converges. Therefore, such a counterexample isn't possible. Therefore, the conclusion is that ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) must converge.\\n\\nSo, after all this thinking and checking with different examples and approaches, I believe the answer is that the series ∑(a_n²)/(1 +a_n²) converges.\\n</think>To determine the nature of the series \\\\( \\\\sum \\\\frac{a_n^2}{1 + a_n^2} \\\\) given that \\\\( \\\\sum a_n \\\\) is a convergent series with \\\\( a_n \\\\geq 0 \\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. **Convergence of \\\\( \\\\sum a_n \\\\)**:\\n   Since \\\\( \\\\sum a_n \\\\) converges, it follows that \\\\( a_n \\\\to 0 \\\\) as \\\\( n \\\\to \\\\infty \\\\).\\n\\n2. **Behavior of \\\\( \\\\frac{a_n^2}{1 + a_n^2} \\\\)**:\\n   For sufficiently large \\\\( n \\\\), \\\\( a_n \\\\) is small.

They operate on one or more boolean operands and return a boolean result.

For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\ny = 10\\nresult = (x > 0) and (y < 20)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nThe \"OR\" operator returns true if at least one of its operands is true, and false otherwise.

For example:\\n\\n```python\\nx = 5\\nresult = not (x > 10)  # This expression evaluates to True\\n```\\n\\nOperator precedence refers to the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.

I need to solve the equation √(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7, and find all positive values of x. Hmm, radicals can be tricky, but maybe if I can eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides. Let me try that.\\n\\nFirst, let me write down the equation again to make sure I have it right:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) - √(x² - 52) = 7.\\n\\nOkay, so the idea is to isolate one of the radicals and then square both sides. Let me try moving the second radical to the other side:\\n\\n√(x² + 165) = 7 + √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, if I square both sides, maybe I can get rid of the square roots. Let's do that:\\n\\n(√(x² + 165))² = (7 + √(x² - 52))².\\n\\nSimplifying the left side:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))².\\n\\nThe right side is expanded using the formula (a + b)² = a² + 2ab + b². So the right side becomes 7² + 2*7*√(x² - 52) + (√(x² - 52))², which is 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + (x² - 52).\\n\\nSo putting it all together:\\n\\nx² + 165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) + x² - 52.\\n\\nHmm, let's simplify the right side. The x² terms will cancel out, right? Let's subtract x² from both sides:\\n\\n165 = 49 + 14√(x² - 52) - 52.\\n\\nSimplify the constants on the right:\\n\\n49 - 52 is -3, so:\\n\\n165 = -3 + 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, add 3 to both sides to isolate the radical term:\\n\\n165 + 3 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nSo 168 = 14√(x² - 52).\\n\\nDivide both sides by 14:\\n\\n168 / 14 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\n12 = √(x² - 52).\\n\\nNow, square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n\\n12² = x² - 52.\\n\\n144 = x² - 52.\\n\\nAdd 52 to both sides:\\n\\n144 + 52 = x².\\n\\n196 = x².\\n\\nSo x = √196 = 14.\\n\\nBut wait, since the problem states that x is positive, we only take the positive root. So x = 14.\\n\\nBut hold on, when dealing with squaring equations, sometimes extraneous solutions can come up. I should check if this solution actually satisfies the original equation.\\n\\nLet's plug x = 14 back into the original equation:\\n\\n√(14² + 165) - √(14² - 52) = ?\\n\\nCalculate each term:\\n\\n14² is 196.\\n\\nSo first radical: √(196 + 165) = √361 = 19.\\n\\nSecond radical: √(196 - 52) = √144 = 12.\\n\\nSo 19 - 12 = 7, which is exactly the right-hand side. So yes, it checks out.\\n\\nTherefore, the only solution is x = 14. Since the problem says x is positive, we don't have to consider negative roots. So I think that's the answer.\\n</think>\\n\\nTo solve the equation \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\\\) for positive \\\\(x\\\\), we proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Start with the given equation:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} = 7\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. Isolate one of the square roots by moving \\\\(\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\\\) to the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165} = 7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n3. Square both sides to eliminate the square root on the left:\\n   \\\\[\\n   (\\\\sqrt{x^2 + 165})^2 = (7 + \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52})^2\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying both sides, we get:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52} + (x^2 - 52)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. Combine like terms on the right side:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 52 + 49 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying further:\\n   \\\\[\\n   x^2 + 165 = x^2 - 3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n5. Subtract \\\\(x^2\\\\) from both sides:\\n   \\\\[\\n   165 = -3 + 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n6. Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   168 = 14\\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n7. Divide both sides by 14:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12 = \\\\sqrt{x^2 - 52}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n8. Square both sides again to eliminate the square root:\\n   \\\\[\\n   12^2 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n   Simplifying:\\n   \\\\[\\n   144 = x^2 - 52\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n9. Add 52 to both sides to solve for \\\\(x^2\\\\):\\n   \\\\[\\n   196 = x^2\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n10. Take the positive square root (since \\\\(x\\\\) is positive):\\n    \\\\[\\n    x = \\\\sqrt{196} = 14\\n    \\\\]\\n\\n11. Verify the solution by substituting \\\\(x = 14\\\\) back into the original equation:\\n    \\\\[\\n    \\\\sqrt{14^2 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{14^2 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{196 + 165} - \\\\sqrt{196 - 52} = \\\\sqrt{361} - \\\\sqrt{144} = 19 - 12 = 7\\n    \\\\]\\n    The solution checks out.\\n\\nThus, the only positive solution is:\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{14}\\n\\\\]<|im_end|>\\n\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":134},{"cell_type":"code","source":"formatted_non_reasoning_data_with_template =

Here's how:\n\nStep 1: Find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term, which is 6, and add up to the coefficient of the x term, which is -5.\n\nThese numbers are -2 and -3 because (-2) * (-3) = 6 and (-2) + (-3) = -5.\n\nStep 2: Rewrite the quadratic expression using these numbers:\n\n𝒙² - 5𝒙 + 6 = (𝒙 - 2)(𝒙 - 3)\n\nStep 3: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:\n\n𝒙 - 2 = 0 → x = 2\n\n𝒙 - 3 = 0 → x = 3\n\nSo, the solutions are x = 2 and x = 3.<|im_end|>\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":186},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Without Thinking","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"SteamResponse(model=sft_trainer.model, tokenizer=sft_trainer.tokenizer, query=\"Hello how're you doing?\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-08-04T12:13:35.230668Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-08-04T12:13:35.231353Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-08-04T12:13:36.305959Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-08-04T12:13:35.231329Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-08-04T12:13:36.305384Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Trainer.tokenizer is now deprecated.
